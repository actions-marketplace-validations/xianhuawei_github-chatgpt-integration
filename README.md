# GitHub & ChatGPT integration

This PoC is related to the integration of ChatGPT into a GitHub repository through [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

Actually there's no way to allow ChatGPT access a GitHub repository, inclusing the Pull Request permormed in any repository branch.

## Design

We will obtain this integration thanks to GitHub actions. This repository contains an Action that performs the following tasks.

* Pull Request checking and analizing, providing comments abou the repo.

## Use this action in your CI/CD

You need to create two secrets in order to run this action

* `OPENAI_API_KEY` Create an OpenAI developer account and obtain an API acces key
* `GH_TOKEN` Create a GitHub developer access token

Other fields that you can customize are

* `dev-lang` Define the programming language using in your repository

```yaml
name: App Code Review

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened]

          github-token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          github-pr-id: ${{ github.event.number }}
          dev-lang: Swift
          openai-max-tokens: 4096
          #exclude-dir: ""
```

## GitHub Action 

Our shell script must be executable. Make sure the `main.sh` file has execute permissions before using it in a workflow. You can modify the permission from your terminal using these commands.

Using the `update-index` parameter we will be sure that the execution flag will not be reseted every time we fork or create a new branch.

```zsh
$ git add entrypoint.sh
$ git update-index --chmod=+x entrypoint.sh
```
